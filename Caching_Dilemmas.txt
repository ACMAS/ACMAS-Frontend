Caching Dilemma:

	- There are a handful of factors to consider when it comes to the notion of caching.
	
	- In the context of ACMAS this would apply to how different words would end up being added to some form of "pseudo-database" to allow
	  for speedier similar queries/searches down the line
	  
		- To clarify: Just like the standard search by question algorithm(which can cache a previous search(es));
					  search by keyword, after returning results, would in theory assign extracted keywords of a query
					  to every filename related to them, sorted left->right in order of relevance 
	- With a cache of this nature, you introduce the following problems and considerations:
	
		- Regulating cache allowances (what constitutes relevance, and when does it become necessary to partition filename contents)
		
		- How do you "best" handle a situation where multiple keywords point/adhere to the same file?
		
		- etc.
