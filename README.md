On the internet today, there are many services that allow students to help each other with homework from various courses all over the world. However, those services are not free to access, which can make it difficult for everyone to use. ACMAS is a free to use database available for anyone to upload, and view backtests from their specific collegeâ€™s courses, which can be very helpful for test preparation.

## Features

  There are many features that ACMAS will contain to make accessing content and using the database as simple and straightforward as possible. First, ACMAS will be able to support uploading problems as photos/PDFs/scanned in documents.
In addition to this, there will also be the ability to search for problems by a specific school and course, or by specific question, or by image, which would all allow the user to then find the backtests and back work that they are looking for and use them for their own studying.
There also will be links from questions on a backtests to alternative answers to the same question from other sources.
