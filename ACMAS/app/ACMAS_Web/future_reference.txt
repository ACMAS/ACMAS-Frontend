NOTES FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

The current model for searching by keyword is to use yake to extract all keywords from the question. 
After doing this, the code then stores all the keywords of the question in a database so that we dont need to 
re-extract the keywords from files we already parsed since extracting keywords is a costly operation. 
Although extraction is a costly operation, it is fast enough for the low amount of traffic ACMAS gets. 
One edge case that is possible is when two different context questions have the same keywords. 
Currently one solution would be to extract and match the keywords in the order they appear in the original 
question.




One solution to solve the issue of overloading the server with extraction is to have the client extract the 
keywords in their questions instead. In this case, the clients would run the yake program in their browser and
send their results to our servers. This would help offset the load to the clients.




A solution to solve the edge case would be the keyword sorting solution

Q1 Keywords: integrate lambda function C
Q2 Keywords: integrate C lambda function 

These two questions have the same keywords so they would both show up when being queried even though they are two unrelated questions.

If our search query was "How do I integrate lambda in C" the keywords of this query would be
Query keywords: integrate lambda C

If we were to match the key words in in order with the questions we would get

Q1: integrate lambda C
Q2: integrate lambda

C gets skipped over because in our search query, lambda is the second keyword.
