Example:
===============================================================================
language = "en"
max_ngram_size = 1
deduplication_threshold = 0.9
numOfKeywords = 10

custom_kw_extractor = yake.KeywordExtractor(lan=language, n=max_ngram_size, 
            dedupLim=deduplication_threshold, top=numOfKeywords, features=None)

question = "What is 1 plus 1?"

keywords = custom_kw_extractor.extract_keywords(question)
===============================================================================


Keywords would contain the most relevant keywords to the question. For example, the question "How do find the integral of a function" would extract to :

(Integral,0.013)
(function,0.016)
(how,0.03)
(find,0.4)

Where the numbers within the tuples correspond to the relevence factor of that word.

The parameters of the Yake program can be tweaked to obtain different keywords.

lan ------- used to set the language of the extractor
n --------- used to extract words that are within the max_ngram_size
dedupLim -- the similarity parameter that only accepts words that fall within that threshold. 
top ------- used to obtain the top x keywords
features -- a parameter to fine tune the Yake model, it is used to define the way to extract keywords with a specific algorithm eg. KPF or Keyword Performance Factor
