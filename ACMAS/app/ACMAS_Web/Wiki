Overview:
OCR is implemented with the usage of a python module PyMuPDF, which parses a pdf upload and extracts text from it with very high accuracy. 
OCR should be called during each non-text file uploads. Along with the original uploaded file, upload a text file with the same pre-extension name that has the extracted text in it.
Currently the OCR functionality is incomplete.

Issues:
Had some troubles installing and testing PyMuPDF with the python alpine version used.

Solution:
Installed the module from source with custom made wheels to import the package
