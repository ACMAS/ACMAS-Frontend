Query_Limitations:

	- Contextual Ambiguity: Keywords extracted from queries may have multiple meanings or contexts,
	making it challenging for the search engine to determine the user's intent accurately.

	- Synonyms and Variations: The search engine may not recognize synonyms or different word forms (like plurals, verb tenses) 
	as related to the primary keyword, leading to missed relevant results.

	- Misspellings and Typos: Keyword extraction methods might struggle with handling misspellings or typographical errors in queries, which can lead to 
	inaccurate or irrelevant search results.

	- Lack of Semantic Understanding: Simple keyword extraction often lacks semantic understanding, so 
	it may not grasp the overall meaning or nuances of the query.


	- Polysemy: Words with multiple meanings (polysemy) can lead to irrelevant results if the 
	search engine fails to contextualize the keyword within the query.

	- Stop Words and Filter Words: Determining which words to ignore (like common stop words, like a period) can be challenging, 
	and inappropriate filtering can omit crucial aspects of a query.

	- Phrase and Concept Recognition: Simple keyword extraction might not effectively recognize phrases or concepts that should 
	be treated as a single unit, reducing the relevance of search results.

	- Scalability and Performance: As the volume of data and the number of queries increase, 
	maintaining efficient and accurate keyword extraction can be challenging.

	- Query Length Limitations: may have limitations on the length of the query it can process effectively, 
	leading to truncated or oversimplified keyword extraction.
