How yake works (this summary is straight from the link below): 
    YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on text statistical
    features extracted from single documents to select the most important keywords of a text. Our system does not 
    need to be trained on a particular set of documents, neither it depends on dictionaries, external-corpus, size 
    of the text, language or domain. To demonstrate the merits and the significance of our proposal, we compare it 
    against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches (TF.IDF, KP-Miner, RAKE, TextRank, SingleRank, ExpandRank, 
    TopicRank, TopicalPageRank, PositionRank and MultipartiteRank), and one supervised method (KEA). Experimental 
    results carried out on top of twenty datasets (see Benchmark section below) show that our methods significantly 
    outperform state-of-the-art methods under a number of collections of different sizes, languages or domains.
